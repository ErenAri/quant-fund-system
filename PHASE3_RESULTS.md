# Phase 3 Results: Fractional Differentiation

**Date:** 2025-11-03
**Status:** COMPLETE - Minor CV improvement, no trading improvement
**Recommendation:** Move to Phase 4 Meta-Labeling

---

## Executive Summary

Fractional differentiation was successfully implemented and integrated. While it improved **cross-validation stability** (+1% AUC), it did **not improve** test set performance or backtest Sharpe ratio.

**Key Results:**
- **Baseline (Phase 1):** CV AUC 0.529, Test AUC 0.528, Sharpe 1.50
- **Phase 3 (Fracdiff):** CV AUC 0.539 (+1%), Test AUC 0.528 (0%), Sharpe 1.50 (0%)
- **Conclusion:** Stationarity achieved, but no actionable alpha gained

---

## What We Implemented

### 1. Fractional Differentiation Module ✓

**File:** `src/quantfund/features/fracdiff.py`

**Components:**
- `get_weights_ffd()` - Fixed-window fractional differentiation weights
- `frac_diff_ffd()` - Apply FFD to time series
- `test_stationarity()` - Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
- `compute_memory_retention()` - Correlation with original series
- `find_min_d()` - Optimize d parameter for stationarity
- `add_fracdiff_features()` - Add fracdiff columns to dataframe

**Key Features:**
- Fixed-window FFD (practical for real-time)
- Multiple d values (0.3, 0.4, 0.5) for different stationarity levels
- Weight threshold truncation (1e-5) for computational efficiency
- Validated with ADF test and memory retention metrics

### 2. Integration with Feature Engineering ✓

**File:** `src/quantfund/features/core.py`

**Changes:**
- Import `frac_diff_ffd` from fracdiff module
- Compute fracdiff features at d=0.3, 0.4, 0.5
- Add 3 new features: `fracdiff_d30`, `fracdiff_d40`, `fracdiff_d50`
- Total features: 46 → 49 (+3)

**Feature Specification:**
```python
fracdiff_d30 = frac_diff_ffd(close, d=0.3, threshold=1e-5)  # Light differencing, max memory
fracdiff_d40 = frac_diff_ffd(close, d=0.4, threshold=1e-5)  # Moderate differencing
fracdiff_d50 = frac_diff_ffd(close, d=0.5, threshold=1e-5)  # Heavy differencing, max stationarity
```

## Stationarity Testing Results

**Original Prices (SPY Close):**
- ADF Statistic: 0.3454
- P-value: 0.979 (highly non-stationary)
- Result: **Non-stationary** ❌

**Fractionally Differentiated Series:**

| d | Stationary | P-value | ADF Stat | Memory Retention | Coverage |
|---|------------|---------|----------|------------------|----------|
| 0.3 | ✓ Yes | 0.0316 | -3.04 | 74.9% | 31.8% |
| 0.4 | ✓ Yes | 0.0029 | -3.80 | 55.8% | 31.8% |
| 0.5 | ✓ Yes | 0.00008 | -4.70 | 48.6% | 36.9% |

**Analysis:**
- All d values achieved stationarity (p < 0.05)
- Memory retention: 48-75% (lower than ideal 90%)
- Trade-off confirmed: stationarity requires memory loss
- d=0.3 offers best balance: stationary + maximum memory (74.9%)

## Why Fractional Differentiation Didn't Improve Performance

### 1. CV Improvement Didn't Generalize

**Problem:** +1% CV AUC but 0% test AUC improvement

**Explanation:**
- Fracdiff features improved training stability (better cross-validation)
- But did not capture new predictive signals for out-of-sample data
- Indicates overfitting to training period characteristics

**Analogy:** Like studying past exams - helps with practice tests but not real exam

### 2. Memory Loss Too High

**Problem:** Best d=0.3 retains only 74.9% memory (target: 90%+)

**Explanation:**
- Achieving stationarity required significant transformation
- Lost 25% of original price information
- Information loss may have removed useful signals

**Trade-off:** Stationarity vs memory retention
- Lower d → more memory, less stationary
- Higher d → more stationary, less memory

### 3. Financial Data Different from Research

**Research (López de Prado):**
- Used on high-frequency data (tick/minute level)
- More noise to remove via differencing
- Longer time series (years of intraday data)

**Our Data:**
- Daily frequency (already smoothed)
- Shorter time series (5.8 years)
- Less noise to remove

**Conclusion:** Daily data may already be "stationary enough" for ML

### 4. XGBoost May Not Need Stationarity

**Problem:** XGBoost is tree-based, not linear

**Explanation:**
- Tree models split on feature values (thresholds)
- Insensitive to non-stationarity compared to linear models
- Can handle regime changes via splits

**Better For:** Linear models (ARIMA, Ridge, Lasso), LSTM

### 5. Not Enough Differentiating Information

**Problem:** Fracdiff captures long-term memory but not short-term dynamics

**What fracdiff does:**
- Preserves long-term trends (memory)
- Achieves stationarity (removes unit root)

**What fracdiff doesn't do:**
- Capture short-term momentum
- Capture mean-reversion signals
- Capture regime changes

**Existing features already capture:** Momentum (r_5, r_10, MACD), mean-reversion (RSI, Bollinger %B), regimes (EMA crossovers, VIX)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked ✓

1. **Implementation:** Fracdiff module is correct and reusable
2. **Stationarity achieved:** All d values passed ADF test
3. **CV improvement:** +1% AUC shows some value
4. **Integration:** Clean addition to feature pipeline
5. **Testing methodology:** Proper validation of stationarity

### What Didn't Work ❌

1. **No test set improvement:** 0% AUC change
2. **No backtest improvement:** 0% Sharpe change
3. **Low memory retention:** 75% vs target 90%
4. **Coverage loss:** 32-37% data loss from FFD window
5. **Overfitting risk:** CV improvement without test improvement

### What We Learned 💡

1. **Not all research translates:** Academic papers often use different data/models
2. **XGBoost less sensitive:** Tree models may not need stationarity
3. **Daily data different:** Already smoother than intraday data
4. **Memory-stationarity trade-off:** Cannot optimize both simultaneously
5. **CV != Test:** Importance of proper out-of-sample validation

## Better Alternatives

### Phase 4: Meta-Labeling (Recommended Next)

**Why Better:**
- Two-stage approach: direction + bet sizing
- Uses triple barrier for position sizing (correct application!)
- Filters low-confidence predictions
- Expected: +15-25% fewer losing trades

**How it Works:**
1. **Primary model (current):** Predicts direction (long vs short)
2. **Meta-model (new):** Predicts position size given direction
   - Input: Primary probability + market features
   - Triple barrier labels: How much to bet
   - Output: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% position size

**Expected Improvement:** Sharpe 1.50 → 1.70-1.90 (+13-27%)

### Alternative: Feature Selection & Engineering

**Why This Might Work:**
- Current: 49 features, some may be redundant
- Feature selection could reduce overfitting
- New features: Regime indicators, order flow, cross-asset correlations

**Methods:**
1. Feature importance analysis (XGBoost built-in)
2. Recursive feature elimination
3. Add interaction terms (e.g., momentum × volatility)
4. Add regime-conditional features

**Expected Improvement:** Sharpe 1.50 → 1.55-1.65 (+3-10%)

### Phase 5: Advanced Models (Later)

**Only if XGBoost plateaus:**
- LSTM + Attention for temporal patterns
- Transformer for long-range dependencies
- Ensemble: XGBoost + LSTM

## Code Reusability

### Keep for Future ✓

**Files to Retain:**
- `src/quantfund/features/fracdiff.py` - May be useful for:
  - Intraday strategies (60m, 120m)
  - Linear models (if we try them)
  - LSTM feature preprocessing
  - Academic research validation

**Use Cases:**
1. **Intraday data:** 60m/120m bars may benefit more than daily
2. **Linear models:** Ridge/Lasso/ARIMA require stationarity
3. **LSTM preprocessing:** Stationary inputs may help RNN training
4. **Feature diversity:** Keep as part of feature set for ensemble

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action (Phase 4)

**Implement Meta-Labeling with Triple Barrier:**

1. **Keep current model:** Direction prediction (Sharpe 1.50)
2. **Add meta-model:** Bet sizing model
   - Input: Primary probability + market features
   - Labels: Triple barrier (profit/stop/timeout)
   - Output: Position size (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
3. **Combine:** Direction × Bet Size = Final Position

**Why This Will Work:**
- Correct use of triple barrier (position sizing, not prediction)
- Filters low-confidence trades (reduces losses)
- Academic support: López de Prado, Hudson & Thames
- Expected: +15-25% improvement in risk-adjusted returns

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Alternative: Feature Engineering

**If meta-labeling doesn't work, try:**
1. Feature selection (reduce 49 → 30 features)
2. Add interaction features (momentum × volatility)
3. Add regime-conditional features
4. Cross-asset correlation features

**Timeline:** 1 week

## Conclusion

Phase 3 (Fractional Differentiation) achieved **technical success** but **no trading improvement**:

**Technical Success:**
- Stationarity achieved (ADF p-values < 0.05)
- +1% CV AUC improvement (0.529 → 0.539)
- Clean implementation and integration

**Trading Reality:**
- Test AUC: 0.528 (no change)
- Sharpe: 1.50 (no change)
- No actionable alpha gained

**Key Insight:** Stationarity helps with model training stability but doesn't guarantee better predictions. XGBoost tree models may not benefit from stationarity as much as linear models or LSTMs.

**Next Step:** Phase 4 - Meta-Labeling
- More promising approach for XGBoost
- Correct use of triple barrier (bet sizing, not prediction)
- Expected: +13-27% Sharpe improvement
- Target: Sharpe 1.70-1.90
